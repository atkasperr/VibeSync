## 📱 Overview

**VibeSync** is a prototype mobile app designed to revolutionize how we make plans and engage with entertainment media. Born out of the frustration of indecisive group planning, VibeSync helps users sync with friends, discover local events, and create shared experiences — all in one place.

In a post-COVID world where digital entertainment dominates, VibeSync brings the focus back to **in-person connection** and **local culture**.
